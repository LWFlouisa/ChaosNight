## My Prompt
Anti-Grandia, ala Chaos Night, would have similar types of active time strategy turn based combat, and retaining the us of 2.5D graphics, specifically 2D sprites over 3D rendered landscapes.

Rather than Manga Eggs, it would use technology in place of Magic Harvesting, and these would be embedded into weapons and skillsets that the play would use.

Another difference is that you wouldn't die, but simply return to town. But you would permanently lose your weapon that breaks, and you have to purchase another one.

Dungeons would be randomly generated like in Rouguelike games, but differs in the US of an actual storyline and character development that would retain players.

## Phind Says
Based on your provided context, it seems like you are looking to expand on gameplay elements for a turn-based RPG with active time strategy combat. Here are some ideas and considerations to help you expand on these concepts:

- Graphics: It seems like you want to use 2.5D graphics with 2D sprites over 3D rendered landscapes, similar to some mobile games like Asphalt 4: Elite Racing and Iron Man 2 [Source 4]. You might want to consider using a pixel art game kit like the Pixel Turn Based Combat RPG Game Kit [Source 14] to create your sprites and backgrounds.

- Combat: You mention that you want to use active time strategy turn-based combat, which has been done in games like Grandia and Child of Light [Source 13]. Consider adding a system where players can manipulate enemy turn orders and cancel turns [Source 13]. You could also incorporate a system where players can push an enemy's turn further back, which would allow for more strategic decision-making [Source 13]. 

- Technology: Instead of using magic, you want to use technology in place of magic harvesting, which would be embedded into weapons and skillsets that the player would use. Consider creating a wide range of skills that offer different opportunities for the player to make decisions. For example, you could have hackers implant elemental bombs on an enemy that detonate when the corresponding element hits it, while fortuners have skills that specifically do more damage on enemies with specific status ailments [Source 5].

- Death system: In your game, players wouldn't die, but simply return to town. However, they would permanently lose their weapon that breaks, and they would have to purchase another one. This creates a consequence for players that is not as severe as death, but still requires them to make strategic decisions about their equipment and resources. Consider adding other types of constraining measures that allow the player to grow, such as stripping the player of all weapons and power-ups, and forcing them to regain them throughout the game [Source 9].

- Dungeons: You mention that dungeons would be randomly generated like in rogue-like games, but would differ in the use of an actual storyline and character development that would retain players. Consider adding a system where players can make decisions that affect the storyline and character development. For example, you could have branching paths that lead to different outcomes and character interactions, which would allow players to make meaningful choices that affect the game's narrative.

These are just a few ideas to help you expand on your gameplay elements. Remember to consider your target audience and create a system that your team can implement effectively and that fits with the theme and atmosphere of your game [Source 5]. Good luck with your game development!
