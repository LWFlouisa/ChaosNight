# ChaosNight
A theoretical JRPG framework that's the Anti-Thesis of the Grandia RPG series.

## Music Elements
The main theme would be written in a fusion of Aeolian Mode and Super Locrian mode, with the goal of retaining the feeling of adventure in Grandia, while being more spooky and depressing.

## Story Elements
Background context is based on the French-Japanese wars, often compared to the Spanish Civil War and Sino-Japanese wars. The MC is a hybrid creature, whom seeks to prevent the world from returning to chaos.

## Gameplay
Monsters are a mixture of French and Japanese mythology, and science experiments gone wrong during the war that have unpredictable or emergent abilities.

Chaos Night would have similar types of active time strategy turn based combat, and retaining the us of 2.5D graphics, specifically 2D sprites over 3D rendered landscapes.

Rather than Manga Eggs, it would use technology in place of Magic Harvesting, and these would be embedded into weapons and skillsets that the play would use.

Another difference is that you wouldn't die, but simply return to town. But you would permanently lose your weapon that breaks, and you have to purchase another one.

Dungeons would be randomly generated like in Rouguelike games, but differs in the US of an actual storyline and character development that would retain players.
