Based on the provided search results, it is not clear what musical mode was used in the "Theme of Grandia" from the Grandia game soundtrack. However, the music seems to have a grand and adventurous feel to it, with a range of orchestral and synthesized tracks that evoke different moods. To make a piece of music darker and more depressing, one could experiment with using different musical modes, such as Dorian or Aeolian modes.

The Dorian mode is similar to a minor scale, but with a natural 6th scale degree and a flat 7th. It can sound melancholic yet brighter than a typical minor scale, creating a sense of restlessness. This mode is often used in Celtic and Irish music, as well as folk, country, blues, and bluegrass genres. Examples of songs that use the Dorian mode include Chris Isaak's "Wicked Game," Daft Punk's "Get Lucky," and Tears for Fears' "Mad World." [3]

The Aeolian mode is the natural minor scale, which provides a modern blues sound of sadness, regret, resentment, and despair. It has a flattened 6th and 7th scale degree, which can give it a slight sense of the Renaissance era. This mode appears in hundreds of thousands of minor key songs, particularly in rock music due to its relation to the minor pentatonic scale. [3]

It's worth noting that the use of different modes is just one of many ways to create a darker and more depressing tone in music. Other factors to consider include tempo, dynamics, instrumentation, and harmony. It's also important to keep in mind the context and purpose of the music, as certain modes and techniques may not be suitable for every situation.

Overall, while the specific mode used in the "Theme of Grandia" is unknown, there are different modes and techniques one could use to create a darker and more depressing tone in music. Experimenting with different approaches and taking into account the context and purpose of the music can lead to unique and compelling results.
