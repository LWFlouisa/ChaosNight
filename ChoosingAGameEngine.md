## My Prompt
Are there free and open source game engines that are specifically suited to this kind of game?

## Phind Says
Yes, there are free and open source game engines that can be used to develop a game like ChaosNight. Here are some of the most well-known ones:

1. Godot: Godot is a powerful 2D and 3D cross-platform game engine. It is completely free and open source under the permissive MIT license. Games created with Godot are programmed in C++, C#, and GDScript, which is Godot's own coding language and a variant of Python. With its active development community and easy-to-learn language, Godot is a great choice for indie game developers. [Source 14]

2. GDevelop: GDevelop is an open source, cross-platform game creator designed to be used by everyone - no programming skills required. It uses a graphically assisted scripting approach to develop games for PC or mobile. GDevelop is a good choice for beginners and those who want to quickly prototype their game ideas. [Source 5]

3. AnyRPG: AnyRPG is a role-playing game engine written in C# for Unity. It is a 100% free and open source project with the goal of enabling content creators to rapidly create unique and engaging short stories, scenarios, adventures, and even full games. It provides a platform with the most common RPG functionality out of the box. [Source 6]

4. Openage: Openage is a free cross-platform real-time strategy game engine that provides the mechanics of Age of Empires. It uses modern technologies like C++17, OpenGL/GLSL, Python, Qt5, and CMake, allowing people using GNU/Linux, BSD, macOS, or Windows to play the game natively. Openage is popular for the games developed by this engine like the Age of Empires I and II and Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds. [Source 14]

5. GemRB: GemRB is a portable open-source implementation of Bioware's Infinity Engine. It was written to support pseudo-3D role-playing games based on the Dungeons & Dragons ruleset (Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale series, Planescape: Torment). It should run on GNU/Linux, Microsoft Windows, OS X, and possibly other UNIX derivatives. It is licensed under the GPL. [Source 14]

When choosing a game engine, it's important to consider the pros and cons of each. Here are some things to keep in mind:

Pros:
- Free and open source
- Active development community
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Easy-to-learn language

Cons:
- May have limited features compared to paid game engines
- May require more technical knowledge to use
- May not have as much documentation or support available

Ultimately, the choice of game engine will depend on the specific needs and goals of the developer.
